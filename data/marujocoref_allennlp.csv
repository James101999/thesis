1,"Movie Review - '' `` In A Better World '' '' - Considering the number of ethical dilemmas raised in A Better World , I wish I could say I 'd been left with more questions rattling around in I's head than '' `` What on earth were the Oscar voters thinking ? '' '' Taking home the trophy for Best Foreign Language Film will certainly help A Better World find an audience at art houses . And there 's a lot to be said for A Better World A Better World's . But after a few queasy moments at A Better World's midpoint , the trajectory of A Better World becomes so relentlessly platitudinous that an audience that ought to feel seriously rattled will be settling back , feeling comfortably reassured . settling 's not true early on , as Susanne Bier 's cuts between Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation , and Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation's put-upon adolescent son Elias -LRB- Markus Rygaard -RRB- , who 's at home and being tormented in his put-upon adolescent son Elias -LRB- Markus Rygaard -RRB- , who 's at home and being tormented in his father 's absence by a school bully's absence by a school bully . his put-upon adolescent son Elias -LRB- Markus Rygaard -RRB- , who 's at home and being tormented in his father 's absence by a school bully finds an ally when Christian -LRB- William Johnk Nielsen -RRB- joins the class - a well-spoken , polite kid whose anger at Christian -LRB- William Johnk Nielsen -RRB-'s mother 's recent death -LRB- from cancer -RRB- needs an outlet . Christian -LRB- William Johnk Nielsen -RRB-'s philosophy about dealing with bullies , which is basically that if you hit back hard enough the first time , you wo n't need to hit back again , is n't one that school authorities would likely approve . But it changes the dynamics of his put-upon adolescent son Elias -LRB- Markus Rygaard -RRB- , who 's at home and being tormented in his father 's absence by a school bully's life pretty quickly . it also has predictably dire repercussions when the boys decide to apply it to other conflicts . Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation , meanwhile , is confronted with ethical dilemmas of Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation's own when Big Man , a brutal local warlord whose savagery keeps Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation's operating table full , comes in with a life-threatening wound . From there Susanne Bier 's whips absent parents , pipe bombs , the Hippocratic oath , marital infidelity , impotent authority figures and other ingredients into a potent melodramatic brew that poses but does n't answer such questions as whether violence is sometimes necessary or always a poisoner of souls , and whether turning the other cheek establishes moral authority or destabilizes social order . Contrasting warm African golds with chilly Danish greens , Susanne Bier 's matches striking visuals with overtly melodramatic situations - children with access to rooftops and fireworks to get your protective juices flowing , predators so unsubtle predators so unsubtle's comeuppance seems a foregone conclusion . Susanne Bier 's creates some genuinely disturbing moments - a scene in which Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation allows a bullying father to strike Anton -LRB- Mikael Persbrandt -RRB- , a humanitarian Danish doctor dealing with the aftereffects of tribal violence in an unspecified African nation again and again in front of the kids , a harrowing exchange with Big Man , a brutal local warlord whose savagery keeps Anton 's operating table full , as Big Man , a brutal local warlord whose savagery keeps Anton 's operating table full , begins to heal - but resolves some genuinely disturbing moments in ways that allow the audience , if not Susanne Bier 's's protagonists , to shrug off moral consequences . There 's sufficient craft that you go along with the twists , even as Susanne Bier 's is wrapping things up with a neatly tied bow . But in a better world , In a Better World would be a better movie .",matches basically anton's authorities putupon unspecified ways violence feeling chilly begins moments conflicts anton questions comeuppance harrowing order contrasting markus hit parents allow recent oath hippocratic lifethreatening relentlessly world language protagonists operating table full christian's children considering susanne pretty quickly consequences african nation disturbing man danish earnest danish greens wellacted better world

12,"Mossad 's not so secret operation A scandal is flaring up after the arrest of a Palestinian engineer was confirmed by the Israeli government . a Palestinian engineer , vanished from a train near Kiev on February 19 , allegedly the arrest of a Palestinian engineer by Mossad 's . a Palestinian engineer appeared in court on Thursday for a hearing on extending a Palestinian engineer's detention . Prosecutors asked court to allow a Palestinian engineer to be held for five more days after which a Palestinian engineer would be officially charged . At this stage , the story seems to have more questions than answers . a Palestinian engineer went missing while traveling from the Ukrainian city of Kharkov to Kiev . Two men reportedly walked into a Palestinian engineer's compartment , produced IDs of special services officers and removed a Palestinian engineer from a train near Kiev . A sequence of mysterious events then unfolded , confusing not only the family of a Palestinian engineer and the media , but even the Ukrainian officials . Some reported that a Palestinian engineer turned up at the Israeli prison the next day after a Palestinian engineer had been abducted ; later a number of media reported the same information but only on March 10 . Israeli authorities officially confirmed the same information on March 20 , when court bowed to human rights activists and admitted that a Palestinian engineer was being kept in jail in the Israeli government , according to Itar-Tass news agency . Finally , the situation became more or less clear when the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu openly admitted on Thursday that a Palestinian engineer had indeed been kept in prison in the Israeli government saying : '' `` a Palestinian engineer is a Hamas member . a Palestinian engineer is being held in the Israeli government . a Palestinian engineer supplied the Israeli government with valuable information . '' '' But the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not elaborate . a Palestinian engineer's alleged connection to Hamas was named by the media , almost straight away , as one of the reasons for such drastic actions . However , both a Palestinian engineer and a Palestinian engineer's Ukrainian wife Veronika deny all allegations . Moreover , his Ukrainian wife Veronika appealed to the UN High Commission for Refugees to address the issue . his Ukrainian wife Veronika believes that the arrest of a Palestinian engineer was performed by Mossad 's . '' `` How can his Ukrainian wife Veronika explain to his Ukrainian wife Veronika's children that my children's was n't killed by a bomb in Palestine but disappeared from a train in a democratic country ? '' '' his Ukrainian wife Veronika told Ukraine 's Kyiv Post . According to a Palestinian engineer's account that a Palestinian engineer gave to the lawyer who was allowed to visit a Palestinian engineer in jail - from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights -LRB- PCRH -RRB- , a Gaza-based NGO - the people who abducted a Palestinian engineer on a train near Kiev wore Ukrainian military uniform , the people who abducted him on the train took a Palestinian engineer's documents by force , then removed a Palestinian engineer from a train near Kiev and drove a Palestinian engineer to Kiev . a Palestinian engineer says a Palestinian engineer was held and interrogated in an apartment by individuals who identified individuals who identified themselves as members of Mossad as members of Mossad 's . Another reason for such actions , as speculated by the Israeli media , is a Palestinian engineer's possible connection to the arrest of a Palestinian engineer , and the belief that a Palestinian engineer knows an Israeli Defense Forces soldier , Gilad Schalit's current whereabouts . Noam Shalit , the father of an Israeli Defense Forces soldier , Gilad Schalit , even called on the family of a Palestinian engineer on Thursday to pressure Hamas to reach a deal that would bring about the release of Noam Shalit , the father of abducted IDF soldier ,'s , reports Israeli Haaretz newspaper . After appearing in court on Thursday , a Palestinian engineer , when asked , told the press : '' `` a Palestinian engineer do n't know anything about an Israeli Defense Forces soldier , Gilad Schalit . a Palestinian engineer do n't know anything . a Palestinian engineer 'm an engineer , '' '' as quoted by Israeli Haaretz newspaper . According to the Jerusalem Post 's report on Friday , when asked about the possibility of a Palestinian engineer being exchanged for an Israeli Defense Forces soldier , Gilad Schalit , the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment . However , the Israeli government's defense minister , Ehud Barak , in an interview to Israel Army radio said that : '' `` a Palestinian engineer did n't organize the arrest of a Palestinian engineer or guard an Israeli Defense Forces soldier , Gilad Schalit but a Palestinian engineer is a person with intimate internal information on Hamas . '' '' What seems to be particularly intriguing in the whole story is how exactly a Palestinian engineer was removed from Ukraine 's . RT spoke to a former security officer in Ukraine 's who said that in case of a planned operation between the two countries ' intelligence services , a Palestinian engineer would simply be arrested quietly and deported . In this case , however , both the Ukrainian intelligence and the Interior Ministry have said both the Ukrainian intelligence and the Interior Ministry had no idea of such a plan by both the Ukrainian intelligence and the Interior Ministry's Israeli counterparts . Moreover , Ukraine 's's Interior Minister , Aleksandr Mogilyov , is set to visit the Israeli government , to try to find out more details behind the arrest of a Palestinian engineer the Ukrainian side . The unfolding story , a thriller of The unfolding story , a thriller of its kind's kind , is not the first time that Israeli intelligence has undertaken such acts . In January 2010 , a man believed to be connected to the Hamas terrorist cell , was assassinated in a hotel in Dubai . Eleven men with fake French , Irish and other passports were put on the international wanted list by the UAE . However , that story seems far from being resolved , despite the fact that the Israeli government did not deny Mossad 's's involvement .",israel's defense minister ehud barak human rights activists israeli court hamas israeli government dirar abu sisi scandal un high commission for refugees israeli prison itartass news agency israeli intelligence service israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu dubai eleven men palestinian center for human rights pcrh ukraine's interior minister aleksandr mogilyov assassinated kidnapped engineer noam shalit january 2010 deny all allegations kiev ukraine's kyiv post kidnapped international wanted list israeli haaretz newspaper israeli defense forces soldier gilad schalit hamas terrorist cell ukrainian officials israeli authorities jerusalem post's mossad's the guardian mossad palestinian israel uae hotel prosecutors admitted ukrainian arrested commission international wanted vanished elaborate engineer intimate information abduction netanyahu secret operation connection allegedly kidnapped ukrainian military removed

14,"Andrew Young interviewed again in Edwards case WASHINGTON Prosecutors investigating Edwards spent several hours Thursday re-interviewing Andrew Young . Andrew Young met with Prosecutors investigating former Sen. John Edwards in Andrew Young's attorney 's WASHINGTON office for more than four hours . The Associated Press spotted Andrew Young leaving his attorney 's Washington office's underground garage in a vehicle with a North Carolina license plate registered to Andrew Young's wife , Cheri , at their home in Chapel Hill . met is particularly notable because of met's timing . Andrew Young has already been questioned by a grand jury investigating Edwards in 2009 , and the Justice Department is considering whether to move forward with an indictment . Prosecutors investigating former Sen. John Edwards could be interested in taking a closer look at Andrew Young to see how Andrew Young 'll hold up as a witness , since Andrew Young's credibility could be problematic . Young , who was an aide to Edwards's 2008 presidential campaign , initially claimed Andrew Young was the father of Edwards ' out-of-wedlock baby and traveled around the country helping keep Edwards's mistress , Rielle Hunter , hidden . Andrew Young has since come out with a book detailing Andrew Young's role in covering up Edwards's paternity of Edwards ' out-of-wedlock baby . Andrew Young now says Andrew Young made a mistake in judgment by lying . a book detailing his role in covering up Edwards ' paternity of the baby is being turned into a Hollywood film . Edwards acknowledged in January 2010 that Edwards fathered Edwards ' out-of-wedlock baby . Last year , a North Carolina judge said a North Carolina judge was troubled by a series of seemingly conflicting statements that Andrew Young made under oath in a lawsuit over a purported sex tape depicting Edwards . a North Carolina judge considered sending Andrew Young to jail for contempt but backed away as Andrew Young's attorneys argued that a series of seemingly conflicting statements that Young made under oath in a lawsuit over a purported sex tape depicting Edwards were memory lapses . Andrew Young has said Andrew Young had a purported sex tape depicting Edwards simply to corroborate Andrew Young's story . Andrew Young's attorney , David Geneson , did not return a call for comment on met , and the Justice Department declined to comment . The investigation centers on the money spent to keep Edwards ' mistress , Rielle Hunter , and Andrew Young in hiding . Investigators are looking chiefly at whether money paid to Hunter and Young - from outside political groups and Edwards's political donors - should have been considered campaign donations since money paid to Hunter and Young - from outside political groups and Edwards ' political donors - arguably aided Edwards's presidential bid . Andrew Young would be the chief witness , since one donor who gave Hunter and Young money has died and the second is 100 years old . Haunted by other case The investigation is being jointly run by the Republican-appointed U.S. attorney in Raleigh and the public integrity section of Justice Department in WASHINGTON . the Justice Department has reason to be cautious in pursuing the case after the public integrity section of Justice Department in Washington's last prosecution of a high-profile politician , the late Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens , ended so badly . A judge overturned a high-profile politician , the late Alaska Republican Sen. Ted Stevens's conviction and ordered a criminal investigation into Prosecutors investigating former Sen. John Edwards's conduct after the public integrity section of Justice Department in Washington admitted the public integrity section of Justice Department in Washington's lawyers did not turn over important , exculpatory evidence to the defense team .

15,"New Life for the Art of Lace-Making The Return of Lace as a Major Fashion Trend is Giving a Boost to a Once-Faltering European Business Caudry , France Lace , suddenly , is everywhere . Looking nothing like your grandmother 's doilies , lace is the fabric of whole dresses and suits for summer , as well as next fall . Lace has n't been this popular since Queen Victoria sat on the throne . The lavish lace is a dramatic change -- not only for high fashion but also for a European industry that has been dwindling since the 1920s . Europe was once famous for lace -- hundreds of types of Swiss , Belgian , French and at one point even English lace . Now , much of the lace shown on high-end runways comes from one town in northeastern France . The French lace industry was famous when Jerry Lee Lewis crooned , '' `` Chantilly lace and a pretty face ... '' '' in the 1950s . But Chantilly lace is no longer made in Chantilly . The high-end lace industry has mostly shrunk to the area around a town called Caudry , where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss supply the likes of Christian Dior , Chanel , Jean Paul Gaultier , Jason Wu and Valentino . the area around a town called Caudry , where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss is known for the area around a town called Caudry , where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss's stinky Maroilles cheese and the slurry of the area around a town called Caudry , where rival companies Sophie Hallette and Solstiss's '' `` Ch 't is '' '' dialect , made famous in France by the 2008 comedy '' `` Bienvenue Chez Les Ch 't is '' '' or '' `` Welcome to the Sticks . '' '' The factories here specialize in '' `` Leavers '' '' lace , using looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace . looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace can work cotton , silk , rayon , polyester , wool or other materials into exquisite laces that are sturdier than exquisite laces that are sturdier than they look look . -LRB- Handmade lace is now a hobbyist 's product , though some machine lace is embellished by hand . -RRB- Of course , looms that imitate the intricate knotting of 18th-century handmade lace are far slower than the knitting machines now used to make mass-market lace in China . Heidi Cho , who trades in lace at Victorian Lace & Trim , a Los Angeles-based lace wholesaler , sells large quantities of Chinese lace to fast-fashion and budget-clothing manufacturers in the U.S. '' `` The China quality is low , but the price is low , Heidi Cho , who trades in lace at Victorian Lace & Trim , a Los Angeles-based lace wholesaler , says . Created with an entirely different technique , Chinese lace is n't nearly as nuanced or beautiful . Still , Chinese factories have n't made headway into the market for couture-level lace -- largely because new Leavers machines have n't been manufactured in decades . Outside of bridal trims and lingerie , lace has n't been a big part of women 's wardrobes in recent decades . Perhaps been 's partly because lace 's so truly , almost wholly feminine -- in an era when women have been focused on competing with men . The fashion industry 's most contrarian designer , Miuccia Prada , prepared the way for lace 's comeback . For fall 2008 , The fashion industry 's most contrarian designer , Miuccia Prada , used heavy Swiss-made lace -- a type more often used in curtains -- in The fashion industry 's most contrarian designer , Miuccia Prada ,'s skirts , dresses and accessories . French lace makers celebrated , knowing The fashion industry 's most contrarian designer , Miuccia Prada , was likely to influence other designers . Sophie Hallette 's U.S. sales representative , Jane Pincus , recalls that Sophie Hallette 's U.S. sales representative , Jane Pincus , was at a Paris fabric trade show in the spring of 2008 when word spread about the huge The fashion industry 's most contrarian designer , Miuccia Prada , order . '' `` There was champagne popping in the booth , '' '' Sophie Hallette 's U.S. sales representative , Jane Pincus , says . '' `` The sheer size -- they put The sheer size on every product -- the shoes , the bags . '' '' Then the financial crisis hit , with Lehman Brothers collapsing in September . Many designers stripped expensive details from Many designers's collections to slash prices . In late 2009 , Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , used a wedge of Sophie Hallette 's lace at the neck of a gown that was priced for retail at $ 450 . Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , says one U.S. luxury retailer asked Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , to use cheaper Chinese lace to bring the price of a gown that was priced for retail at $ 450 closer to $ 350 . cheaper Chinese lace cost $ 22.33 per yard , compared with $ 2 or $ 3 per yard for lace from China , Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , says . This was n't the most expensive lace -- in fact , the average wholesale price of Sophie Hallette 's lace is about $ 63 a yard , says Maud Lescroart , Sophie Hallette 's's head of marketing . At retail , a garment is often priced at five or six times what it cost the designer to make , after markups by Sophie Hallette 's , the retailer and sometimes middlemen . So $ 20 of lace can raise the ultimate price of a dress by $ 100 . '' `` They did n't understand why Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , would n't just put Chinese lace on a garment , '' '' says Don O'Neill , designer of the midpriced Theia line , . Not every designer made the same decision . During the financial crisis , Sophie Hallette 's laid off 25 % of Sophie Hallette 's's work force in Caudry -- a painful time for Sophie Hallette 's . Now , as the world economy sputters along in recovery mode , lace has a fresh new appeal for designers . Indeed , European couture lace provides a near-perfect metaphor for what 's going on in the luxury market , where designers have been rethinking classic materials from mink to pearls . Lace is expensive and utterly traditional , yet Lace 's being put to use in a modern , whole-hog way , such as a hoop-shaped lace skirt from Yohji Yamamoto or Valentino's winter coat with lace stitched over a more substantial fabric . Some of the machines in action at the Sophie Hallette 's factory in Caudry are 100 years old , says Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing . Many jobs are inherited from parents . Eric Lernon operates a tulle loom that Eric Lernon's father worked on as a tulliste . '' `` Sophie Hallette 's 's like a 19th-century company in the 21st century , '' '' Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing says , glancing around the factory floor where Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing spent a good deal of Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing's childhood . In a showroom , Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing and creative director Pierre Alain Cornaz pull out lace trims so complex that it takes a person two days to make one meter . Often details such as embroidery , sequins and other embellishments are added by hand . New lace patterns from Mr. Cornaz are drawn by hand -- every single thread -- by a team at the Sophie Hallette factory in Caudry . The lace patterns a team at the factory were drawing in February 2011 will be seen on runways more than a year later , in September 2012 , and the clothes will hit stores in January of 2013 . Threading the tulle loom takes two months and two people , says Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing . '' `` Tell the designers takes 's why it takes so long to fill the designers's orders , '' '' Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing jokes . In another room , women mend tiny faults by hand , holding the lace on women's laps . '' `` another room is a woman 's room , '' '' says Maud Lescroart , the company 's head of marketing . '' `` mend takes patience . '' '' Down a hallway in a laboratory , chemist Philippe Desmaretz measures dyes in beakers and vials .

Gehry Art Museum will hold Bernard Arnault 's's vast corporate and private collections of art , including 20th-century classics from Picasso , Yves Klein , Henry Moore and Andy Warhol mixed with modern work by Agnes Martin , Frank Serra , Jeff Koons and Pierre Huyghe . Earlier this year , the administrative tribunal of Paris , a part of the national judiciary system , had revoked Gehry Art Museum's building permit citing Gehry Art Museum's apparent encroachment on the Jardin d'Acclimatation , a childrens park next to the building site . Opponents to the building site had also complained that a new building would disrupt the verdant peace of the Jardin d'Acclimatation , a childrens park next to the building site . Christophe Girard , the deputy mayor in charge of culture of Paris and the director of marketing strategy for the fashion sector of LVMH , filed and won an appeal . Frank Gehry , for Frank Gehry's part , told reporters Frank Gehry was `` distressed , shocked and furious '' at the threat to Frank Gehry's . Frank Gehry's spokesman criticized the `` selfishness , lack of civic pride and ignorance '' of the groups opposing Gehry Art Museum and predicted that in a few years Gehry Art Museum will be considered `` a national monument . '' Located in the center of the Bois de Boulogne , Gehry Art Museum will look like an iceberg dressed in a cloud , '' according to Bernard Arnault 's's cultural adviser , Jean-Paul Claverie . Frank Gehry has said the translucent panels are positioned to reflect different colors and light patterns throughout the day .

Hustler was also fined for failing to maintain a written injury and illness policies and for failing to provide workers with vaccines for hepatitis C. a Division of Occupational Safety and Health citation provided to The Associated Press Wednesday stems from a Sept. 14 inspection of a jobs site in response to a complaint from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation , a LOS ANGELES - California nonprofit that advocates for safe sex in pornography . another porn producer faces $ 12,150 in fines for similar violations . fines were issued March 9 .

21,"Tili &#039; s back at SeaWorld and so are the crowds : Tips on seeing the orca show The return of Tili to the orca show on March 30th after an absence of more than a year brought out the crowds to welcome Tili back . Tili is a crowd pleaser because Tili's sheer size allows Tili to soak the crowds very effectively as Tili swims by to chants of '' `` Shamu ! Shamu ! '' '' SeaWorld is debuting a new orca show , One Ocean , in late April , which will no doubt draw even more people . So how do you see the orca show most effectively ? Here are some tips : 1 -RRB- Arrive at Shamu Stadium early . Shamu Stadium opens about half an hour before show time , although people line up before show time on the busiest days . There are refreshment stands and restrooms at Shamu Stadium , so you can get munchies , souvenirs and drinks or make a quick pitstop once you get there . Shamu Stadium is massive , so Shamu Stadium only reaches capacity on the busiest days , but you wo n't have a good seat choice if you get there late . 2 -RRB- Choose your entrance carefully . There are multiple entrances to Shamu Stadium , so do n't just jump into the first line you see on a crowded day . Walk around Shamu Stadium and see if you can find something shorter . 3 -RRB- Be prepared if you sit in the soak section . You really do get wet in the soak section , especially now that Tili is back . Splashing is a big crowd pleasure , so Splashing 's likely to be part of a new orca show , One Ocean , too . Wear a poncho if you do n't want to get your clothes wet , and stash fragile items like cameras and cell phone in plastic bags to protect fragile items like cameras and cell phone . Ride Atlantis , SeaWorld's water ride , after sitting in the soak section since you are already wet , or ride Atlantis , the park 's water ride before the orca show . Advertisement 4 -RRB- Do n't rush out at the end . People tend to jump up and hurry to the exits once the orca show is over . Rather than fighting the crowd , I like to relax for a bit . Sometimes the trainers are around at the end , so you can have a nice chat with the trainers until the massive pack of people is gone . Click here to see a video of Tili's first return performance .

22,"Retiree health cost estimate falls , for a change BOSTON - Rising health care costs are a given . But for the first time in 10 years , the outlook is improving for new retirees wondering whether new retirees wondering whether they 'll be able to pay their medical bills throughout their retirements 'll be able to pay new retirees wondering whether they 'll be able to pay their medical bills throughout their retirements's medical bills throughout new retirees wondering whether they 'll be able to pay their medical bills throughout their retirements's retirements . A 65-year-old couple retiring this year will need $ 230,000 , on average , to cover medical expenses in retirement , according to a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments . That 's down 8 percent from the $ 250,000 projection Fidelity Investments BOSTON made a year ago . falls 's notable because Retiree health cost estimate had risen each year since Fidelity Investments made Fidelity Investments's initial calculation of $ 160,000 in 2002 . Annual increases have averaged 6 percent . Fidelity Investments attributes Fidelity Investments's optimism to President Obama 's year-old health care overhaul , which will reduce many seniors ' out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs . The projections are part of Fidelity Investments's business helping employers design workplace benefits programs . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments is based on projections for A 65-year-old couple retiring this year this year . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments factors in Medicare's premiums , co-payments and deductibles , as well as out-of-pocket prescription costs . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments assumes no employer provided insurance in retirement , and a life expectancy of 85 for women and 82 for men . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments was complicated this year by the health care bill that President Obama 's signed into law in March 2010 . Although the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010's focus is expanding health care access to people under age 65 , the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010 also will benefit many retirees by gradually closing what 's known as the '' `` doughnut hole '' '' coverage gap in the Medicare drug benefit . Fidelity Investments says that 's the key reason why a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments is down this year . But that effect will run that effect's course . Longer-term , retirees ' cost savings are n't expected to offset other factors driving expenses up , such as new medical technologies , greater use of health care services , and more diagnostic tests . expected 's why Fidelity Investments expects a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments will eventually resume a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments's historic pattern of annual increases . '' `` Fidelity Investments expect its historic pattern of annual increases to continue when Fidelity Investments look to 2012 and beyond , '' '' said Sunit Patel , a senior vice president for benefits consulting at Fidelity Investments . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments is a projection of what an average couple would need . Actual costs will vary widely , depending on a couple 's medical needs and how long a couple 's live . a study to be released Thursday by Fidelity Investments also does n't factor in most dental services , or long-term care , such as costs from living in a nursing home . In any given year , about one in four Medicare beneficiaries have drug expenses high enough to hit the doughnut hole , in which about one in four Medicare beneficiaries 're responsible for the full cost of about one in four Medicare beneficiaries's medications . The older one gets , the greater the chances of landing in the doughnut hole , in which they 're responsible for the full cost of their medications at some point because of an illness requiring costly prescription drugs . For 2011 , the coverage gap starts after Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare beneficiaries's insurance plan have spent $ 2,840 on medications . After that , seniors are responsible for roughly the next $ 3,600 . Once total spending reaches about $ 6,440 , Medicare's catastrophic coverage kicks in and beneficiaries pay only a small amount . Under the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010 , the coverage gap will be gradually eliminated by 2020 . When the changes are complete , seniors will just pay the regular 25 percent cost sharing for all seniors's medications . The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit , conducts similar research but , unlike Fidelity Investments , does n't focus on an average . That 's because there are so many variables that impact a retiree 's circumstances , says Paul Fronstin , The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit ,'s director of health research and education . In The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit ,'s latest annual estimate released in November , The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit , projected that a couple with median drug expenses - meaning half of the population would have higher , and half lower - would need $ 158,000 for a 50 percent chance of having saved enough to cover health care expenses in retirement . a couple with median drug expenses - meaning half of the population would have higher , and half lower - 'd need $ 271,000 for a 90 percent chance . The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit ,'s did n't closely examine the savings impact from the health care bill that Obama signed into law in March 2010 because of differences in how The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit , makes The Employee Benefit Research Institute , an independent nonprofit ,'s projections compared with Fidelity Investments .

36,"Benefits of Radiation Therapy Outweigh Risks of a Second Cancer : Study Likelihood that radiotherapy will cause another tumor is low , researchers say TUESDAY , March 29 -LRB- HealthDay News -RRB- - The odds a second cancer will develop after radiation treatment for a first cancer are relatively low , U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers report . In a long-term study of more than 600,000 cancer survivors , an estimated 8 percent of second cancers were attributable to radiation treatment for a first cancer , according to a long-term study of more than 600,000 cancer survivors . The results suggest that other factors , such as lifestyle risks and genetics , cause the majority of second cancers , U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers say . '' `` The results can be used by physicians to really put the risks into perspective when physicians are talking treatment options with physicians's patients , '' '' said lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez , an investigator in National Cancer Institute's radiation epidemiology branch . Patients should feel reassured , lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez , an investigator in the NCI 's radiation epidemiology branch added . '' `` In general , the risks -LSB- of radiation therapy -RSB- are smaller than the benefits , '' '' lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez , an investigator in the NCI 's radiation epidemiology branch said . a long-term study of more than 600,000 cancer survivors is the first to quantify the cancer risks posed by radiation treatment for different malignancies . lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez , an investigator in the NCI 's radiation epidemiology branch and colleagues collected data on 647,672 adult cancer survivors included in the U.S. Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries . 647,672 adult cancer survivors included in the U.S. Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries had survived five years or longer after cancer treatment , and follow-up ran from 1978 to 2007 . U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers looked at outcomes for 15 different types of cancer for which radiation treatment is routine , including cancers of the rectum , larynx , lung , breast , cervix , testicles , prostate , eye and orbit , brain and thyroid . Over the 30 years of follow-up , 9 percent of more than 600,000 cancer survivors developed a second cancer . Of 9 percent of these participants , about 3,300 -LRB- 8 percent -RRB- might have been the result of radiation treatment , U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers said . Second cancers related to earlier radiation therapy varied by type , U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers noted . More than half of second cancers developed in breast and prostate cancer survivors . Four percent of second cancers were in the eye , and 24 percent were cancer of the testicles , U.S. National Cancer Institute researchers found . Patients who had Patients who had their initial cancer when young's initial cancer when young were at the greatest risk of developing a second cancer . Also at high risk were those whose organs received high doses of radiation . The likelihood of developing a secondary cancer increased over time . When these data are put in perspective , the absolute risk for a second cancer is 3 in 1,000 over 10 years after radiation therapy and 5 in 1,000 over 15 years , lead researcher Amy Berrington de Gonzalez , an investigator in the NCI 's radiation epidemiology branch said . '' `` We know that radiation therapy can increase the risk of getting another cancer , but at the same time the benefits outweigh the risks , '' '' said Elizabeth Ward , national vice president for intramural research at the American Cancer Society . Radiation therapy is an important and relatively safe treatment for cancer , Elizabeth Ward , national vice president for intramural research at the American Cancer Society added . Thanks to treatment advances , Elizabeth Ward , national vice president for intramural research at the American Cancer Society said , radiologists today are better able to pinpoint treatment and limit exposure to healthy tissue than radiologists were in the past .

37,"Ristretto | Modernist Coffee Nathan Myhrvold keeps busy . Nathan Myhrvold is an executive at DreamWorks Animation , once studied with Stephen Hawking and donated Tyrannosaurus rex fossils Nathan Myhrvold uncovered in Montana to the Smithsonian . Nathan Myhrvold was profiled by Malcolm Gladwell , is a pal of Bill Gates and spent the last several years working on '' `` Modernist Cuisine , '' '' an encyclopedic six-volume compendium of cutting-edge cooking that is not only one of the most expensive cookbooks ever published -LRB- the list price is $ 625 , though it 's available on Amazon.com for a mere $ 461.62 -RRB- but also one of the heaviest , a fire-door-stopper that tips the scales at more than 40 pounds . An initial print run of 6,000 editions has already sold out . Even more exciting for baristas and home brewers , there 's an entire chapter on coffee , 50 thick pages devoted to coffee . In culinary circles coffee is often a second-class subject , not worth the ink . In it coffee 's treated seriously , and takes coffee's place right next to a section on wine . The chapter is essentially a detailed primer . The chapter outlines how coffee is processed , stored and roasted , and discusses the best grinders -LRB- conical burr -RRB- and the best temperature for drinking -LRB- not scalding hot -RRB- . '' `` Modernist Cuisine '' '' has a boys-with-toys current running through it , so most of The chapter is devoted to espresso and assumes that you have access to a professional or prosumer machine and dream of pulling the perfect shot . I could almost see Mark Prince nodding in approval from across the continent . There 's no knocking the meticulous research that went into The chapter -LRB- there 's a lucid explanation of how coffee is extracted -RRB- , the conclusions -LRB- darker roasts do n't mean stronger coffee -RRB- or the overall sensibility -LRB- Nathan Myhrvold is right , restaurant coffee should be better -RRB- , but there is n't anything new here for the coffee nut . If you read Tim Wendelboe or Scott Rao , check in with Matt Buchanan at Gizmodo or James Hoffmann at jimseven , or even let yourself meander into a conversation with a chatty barista - you 'll already be familiar with much of what 's in The chapter , if not all of The chapter . It 's a shame , because '' `` Modernist Cuisine '' '' is quickly becoming known for educating the educated , either by systematizing techniques -LRB- in his review for The New York Times , his writes : '' `` The table for custard lets you pick your desired consistency based on what percentage of egg you use and the temperature you cook custard to , to create a thick Anglaise-style sauce or a stand-alone custard . his tested The table for custard , The table for custard 's brilliant , his 'll use The table for custard forever . '' '' -RRB- or by explaining the arcane -LRB- John Lancaster of The New Yorker seemed fascinated to learn that because water boils at a higher temperature in New York City than in Mexico City , ovens effectively bake at higher temperatures in New York City than in Mexico City -RRB- . Too bad Nathan Myhrvold does n't do either with coffee . The espresso how-to wo n't hold any surprises for somebody who watches a professional at work , never mind the curious customer who takes an hour-long class at the local coffee shop . The espresso how-to does n't even have a single photo of coffee gear sliced open with an abrasive water-jet cutter . -LRB- The cross-section of a flaming grill in action has become an iconic image from The espresso how-to . -RRB- There 's a Synesso espresso machine with the front plate removed , but that 's too easy . Maybe 's 's the point . If The chapter wo n't blow any minds within coffee , The chapter might indoctrinate a generation of chefs and home cooks who never spent much time thinking about grinders or roast profiles . This probably wo n't sit well with Nathan Myhrvold . So instead of fixating on shortcomings , I 'll spend a moment with something Nathan Myhrvold does well : express Nathan Myhrvold's fanatical love of espresso . In a short passage Nathan Myhrvold recalls confronting Nathan Myhrvold's skepticism of the so-called '' `` God shot , '' '' an espresso so transcendent that it changes your life . Nathan Myhrvold writes : Then one day at the Coffee Fest trade show in Seattle , a barista named Daniel Humphries of Victrola Coffee pulled Nathan Myhrvold a shot of Victrola Coffee's Streamline roast in one of the earliest Synesso machines . '' `` a shot of their Streamline roast in one of the earliest Synesso machines was like nothing else Nathan Myhrvold have ever tasted , a phenomenal and complex layering of flavors .

Nathan Myhrvold walked around the rest of the day haunted by that taste ; that taste was with Nathan Myhrvold for hours . '' `` Nathan Myhrvold 'd had a shot of their Streamline roast in one of the earliest Synesso machines . '' `` Of course now Nathan Myhrvold feel foolish for doubting that God shots exist .

38,"Study by Bay Area 's Buck Institute blazes trail for life span extension and disease treatments A new study by researchers at Bay Area 's Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato validates a promising new approach for extending life span and treating age-related diseases . A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato appears in the March 30 online edition of the prestigious scientific journal Nature . A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato found that a dye , used in laboratories to detect Alzheimer 's disease , extended the life span of nematode worms by more than 50 percent and slowed the disease process in worms bred to mimic aspects of Alzheimer 's disease . a dye , used in laboratories to detect Alzheimer 's disease , is also known as Thioflavin T. Nematodes make excellent subjects for research on aging . Researchers do n't have to wait long for results because nematode worms live only two or three weeks normally , and nematode worms's genetic code has been mapped . It was research on nematodes more than two decades ago that first revealed to scientists that the aging process could be extended via genetic mutations . It had long been believed that aging was an uncontrollable process of deterioration that could n't be altered by single genes . Since then , researchers at Bay Area 's Buck Institute and elsewhere have identified hundreds of genes that affect the life span of nematodes as well as compounds that can trigger the anti-aging effect . Until now , however , scientists did n't know the mechanism at work . '' `` What 's new and exciting about A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato is Bay Area 's Buck Institute think Bay Area 's Buck Institute know what is going on , '' '' said Gordon Lithgow , the Bay Area 's Buck Institute faculty member who led A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato . A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato highlights a process called protein homeostasis , the ability of an organism to maintain the proper structure and balance of an organism's proteins , which are the building blocks of life . '' `` Proteins have a certain three-dimensional shape and if a certain three-dimensional shape is lost by clumping or other types of damage Proteins's function is lost as well , '' '' Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study said . '' `` a process called protein homeostasis , the ability of an organism to maintain the proper structure and balance of its proteins , which are the building blocks of life is well studied in relation to Alzheimer 's disease , Parkinson 's disease and other diseases . '' '' While many degenerative diseases have been linked to a breakdown in a process called protein homeostasis , the ability of an organism to maintain the proper structure and balance of its proteins , which are the building blocks of life , genetic studies have long indicated that protein homeostasis is a major contributor to longevity in complex animals . '' `` Bay Area 's Buck Institute 've had a hunch for a long time that protein homeostasis would be a driving factor for normal aging , and Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study think be 's what Bay Area 's Buck Institute 're seeing here , '' '' Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study said of A new study by researchers at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato . '' `` Somehow these compounds slow the clumping of the proteins together and consequently slow slows down normal aging . '' `` Bay Area 's Buck Institute have been looking for compounds that slow aging for more than 10 years and Thioflavin T is the best Bay Area 's Buck Institute have so far , '' '' Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study said . Aided by a $ 1.7 million grant from the Petaluma-based Larry L. Hillblom Foundation in 2007 , Bay Area 's Buck Institute scientists tested 120,000 chemical compounds on yeast and nematode worms in search of compounds that would slow the aging process . But Thioflavin T was not part of the aging process , Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study said . Testing Thioflavin T was the idea of Silvestre Alavez , a staff scientist in the Gordon Lithgow , the Buck faculty member who led the research study lab . Silvestre Alavez , a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab was trained in neuroscience and knew about the use of these compounds to detect disease-related proteins . Several other compounds Silvestre Alavez , a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab identified have also proven effective in increasing life span in worms . One of Several other compounds he identified is curcumin , the active ingredient in the popular Indian spice turmeric . '' `` People have been making claims about the health benefits of curcumin , the active ingredient in the popular Indian spice turmeric for many years , '' '' Silvestre Alavez , a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab said . '' `` Maybe slowing aging is part of the mechanism of action . '' '' curcumin , the active ingredient in the popular Indian spice turmeric is being tested in several human clinical trials for conditions ranging from colon cancer to rheumatoid arthritis to depression . Silvestre Alavez , a staff scientist in the Lithgow lab said , '' `` Any small molecule that maintains protein homeostasis during aging could be active against multiple disease states .

'' `` What Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory 've been doing is taking these materials and encasing these materials in plastic and making these materials into a very fine powder and that improves these materials's properties , '' '' Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington said . '' `` new process that makes gas behave like liquid Technology can be used with existing cars also means you can pump hydrogen like a fluid and hydrogen 's safe . It is not gong to easily burst into flames , '' '' Cella Energy Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington said . Hydrogen produces only water when Hydrogen is burned and is considered an ideal solution to cutting carbon emissions from petrol or diesel vehicles , which are estimated to cause 25 per cent of all carbon release . But until now , attempts to store hydrogen have not been consumer-friendly so store has not been a viable option . Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory say Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's would allow people to use the carbon-free fuel with people's existing car after a few modifications . '' `` You would pump the carbon-free fuel into your petrol tank of your car - your petrol tank of your car would go off , be heated , drive the carbon-free fuel off , which would go and run your vehicle and then the waste little beads that Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory have created you store in your car . And when you go and refuel your car you have two nozzles . One which puts in the new beads and one which takes out the old beads which goes off to be recycled and the carbon-free fuel added to the old beads which goes off to be recycled and the hydrogen added to it again , '' '' Cella Energy Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington said . developed has been to turn hydrides into fibres or beads , 30 times smaller than a human hair , through a process of electro-spinning . a process of electro-spinning produces a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen . new process that makes gas behave like liquid Technology can be used with existing cars protects hydrides from oxygen and water , prolonging hydrides's life and making it possible to handle hydrides safely in air and because a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen behaves like a liquid , current infrastructure will need minimal modification . '' `` You can use tankers to carry a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen around , '' '' said Cella Energy Chief Scientific Officer Stephen Bennington . '' `` You can take a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen to forecourts and then you can pump a white tissue-like material that can be controlled to capture and release hydrogen into the vehicle and give the customer the same kind of experience the customer have now . '' '' All part of the reason Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory believe Cella Energy , a spin-off from Britain 's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory's could herald a new era of carbon-free motoring .

41,"Jimenez Does n't Have Jimenez's Usual Stuff DENVER -LRB- AP -RRB- -- Jimenez has six different pitches to befuddle batters . On Friday , Jimenez could n't find the proper spin on Jimenez's breaking balls or enough zip on Jimenez's heaters . It added up to a terrible 2011 debut for Jimenez . Jimenez looked like Jimenez was throwing batting practice Friday , laboring through six innings , allowing six runs -- five earned -- on seven hits and a wild pitch in a 7-6 , 11-inning loss to Arizona at Coors Field . Jimenez was long gone by the time Matt Lindstrom 's wild pitch with one out in the top of the 11th inning allowed Gerardo Parra to score from third base with the go-ahead run . All but one of the hits Jimenez allowed went for extra bases , including home runs by Justin Upton and Miguel Montero . Knowing Jimenez lacked Jimenez's usual breaking stuff , Jimenez stuck with fastballs , but his heaters were topping out at 93 mph instead of the usual 99-100 . '' `` If Jimenez have the speed that Jimenez normally do , it 's not easy to hit it even if they know that Jimenez 'm going to be throwing fastball every time , '' '' Jimenez said . '' `` But Jimenez did n't have the movement , Jimenez did n't have the speed . '' '' After averaging 8.7 strikeouts per nine innings last season , Jimenez whiffed just one batter . Jimenez's unusual futility finally caught up to Jimenez in the fifth , when Justin Upton's three-run homer put Arizona ahead 4-3 . '' `` It was n't as electric , '' '' Justin Upton said of Jimenez's repertoire . '' `` Justin Upton do n't know exactly what Jimenez was throwing but It was n't jumping like It usually does . '' '' Jimenez said Jimenez could n't locate Jimenez's curveball in the bullpen warming up and had to stick with fastballs . '' `` fastballs 's the only thing Jimenez had , '' '' Jimenez said . And without the usual oomph , Jimenez did n't even have the usual oomph . In the sixth , Miguel Montero collected Miguel Montero's fifth career hit -- and third career homer -- off Jimenez , sending a 2-1 pitch into the bullpen in right-center to give the Diamondbacks a 6-3 cushion . '' `` It 's kind of weird . To be honest , Miguel Montero do n't think Jimenez was throwing that hard , '' '' Miguel Montero said . '' `` Today Jimenez did n't have the greatest stuff , Jimenez was n't throwing near as hard as -LRB- normal -RRB- and the Diamondbacks were able to take advantage .

Even if said is unfounded or embellished , said could bring fresh headaches in China for Google Google . China generates a small percentage of Google's revenues , but is the world 's largest internet market with more than 450 million users . China's search market , dominated by homegrown Baidu Inc , was worth 11bn yuan -LRB- # 1.05 bn -RRB- in 2010 and is likely to grow by about 50 % each year for the next four years , according to iResearch . a state-run newspaper said that three companies linked to Google Inc were '' `` Google enterprises in China '' '' . '' `` Chinese authorities have already investigated and punished three companies linked to Google Inc according to the law , '' '' said said on said's front page . three companies linked to Google Inc were accused of presenting false and unjustified claims to the total value of 40m yuan , said said . said did not say when the claimed violations are alleged to have happened .

The Wall Street Journal 's homepage rendered in Comic Sans using a search tool that reads your mind . Eek . Google Friday morning launched an all-out campaign to promote Comic Sans on the Web .

But the Google webmaster team said Friday that the Google webmaster team would be rolling out Comic Sans as the default Google font across all Google products on April 4 . the Google webmaster team said experiments had shown that users '' `` thoroughly read every piece of content displayed in Comic Sans '' '' and that it is '' `` the most effective way to achieve user happiness .

To reply all , use both hands . -RRB- And the company posted a job listing Friday for an '' `` autocompleter , '' '' someone to guess what users are searching for and type in the rest of the word before users can , so the word will be added to the list of suggestions given by Google . Other excellent pranks today include an email sent out by the Huffington Post claiming that the company was going to erect a paywall for New York Times employees only and a subtle joke that replaced the normal `` people you may know '' suggestions on LinkedIn with names like `` Albert Einstein .

48,"Windows Phone 7 and the Unimportance of Apps Microsoft says that Windows Phone 7 app marketplace is booming . In a chest-beating blog post , Microsoft revealed that WinPho7 '' `` s app count stands at 11,500 , and WinPho7 '' `` s app count 's without wallpapers or duplicate apps in different languages . The ecosystem has 36,000 developers , 60 percent of which have n't even published anything yet , so the potential for growth is huge . Still , some tech pundits , such as Robert Scoble , insist that a lack of apps is the only reason Windows Phone 7 has n't been a rousing success . How can is be true if the Windows Phone Marketplace is hopping with activity ? First , a bit of qualification : Microsoft do n't know with absolute certainty that Windows Phones are n't selling . Microsoft has only said how many phones Microsoft 's sold to retailers -LRB- 1.5 million as of late December -RRB- , not the number of people who 've actually bought one . But LG has expressed disappointment with sales , and one U.K. retailer claimed that Android phones outsell Windows Phones by a 15 to 1 ratio . It 's safe to say that Windows Phone 7 has n't been a rousing success . Windows Phone 7 Real Challenges But is a lack of apps to blame ? I doubt it . When I consider which phone to buy or recommend to friends , I 'm quick to rule out Windows Phone 7 , but not because of apps . Windows Phone 7's lack of multitasking and HTML5 support are much bigger drawbacks . Same with copy and paste , at least until Microsoft finishes rolling out the '' `` NoDo '' '' software update . And until Windows Phones come to Verizon Wireless , the number of people who can even consider Windows Phone 7 is limited . Windows Phone 7 hardware has also been unimpressive so far . Most handsets do n't have front-facing cameras . None have dual-core processors . Most lack expandable storage , which would n't be an issue if Most included more than 8 GB or 16 GB of on-board storage . Every time an Android phone pushes the hardware envelope , Windows Phone 7 falls further behind . If none of those issues existed , apps might linger in the back of I's mind , but I doubt it . After all , Windows Phone 7 has a great gaming platform in Xbox Live . Windows Phone 7 has apps for Facebook , Twitter , Yelp , Shazam , IMDB and even Netflix , which Android still lacks . With Microsoft's new stats in mind , I simply do n't buy the argument that apps are holding Windows Phone 7 back . If anything , apps 're the biggest bright spot for Windows Phone 7 so far .",limited holding selling onboard storage microsoft's absolute challenges facebook twitter windows phone revealed qualification microsoft unimportance windows phone 7 verizon wireless bigger drawbacks recommend handsets biggest bright spot insist platform huge rousing success unimpressive dualcore processors published windows multitasking ecosystem microsoft finishes imdb argument expandable booming disappointment android phone marketplace android one uk most handsets marketplace duplicate number windows phones bit hopping with don't know the biggest bright spot without wallpapers 15 7s app marketplace retailers december my mind but percent friends have frontfacing cameras software update and absolute certainty aren't selling microsoft says that people who haven't even published anything consider which phone onboard apps it's safe facebook twitter yelp shazam imdb android phones 11500 have dualcore processors growth people expressed disappointment sales issues existed apps might different languages blame say robert scoble insist that hardware real challenges but true developers pundits such chestbeating blog post microsoft revealed that winpho7s even consider buy count stands they included more rousing success windows doubt lack apps further behind only reason lack expandable storage quick potential huge still some actually bought claimed
